                  A Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO is a
                  transparent and autonomous community led entity without any
                  central authority. This means that a DAO is governed by all
                  the members of a project equally and all critical decisions
                  are taken collectively by them.
                  <br />
                  <br />A DAO can be created by numerous crypto wallets that are
                  controlled by either organizations or individuals. All the
                  moments are executed voa code allows the management of assets
                  and votes without having to undergo traditional banking and
                  legal formalities.

                    Smart contract development is behind the foundation of the
                    DAO. Smart contracts regulate the rules of the organization
                    and group treasury. Once the smart contract is conveyed to
                    live on the Ethereum platform, then no one can make
                    variations in the rules guidance except by a consensus. This
                    is possible because smart contracts are tamper-proof once
                    they go live on Ethereum.

                    It will fail if someone tries to change something that is
                    not covered by the codes rules and reasons. Because the
                    treasury is also established by the smart contract, no one
                    can use the money without the permission of the
                    organization.

                    As a result, DAOs do not necessitate a centralized
                    authority. Instead, the group makes decisions collectively,
                    and when votes are passed, transactions are automatically
                    permitted. You cant arbitrarily change the code (the DAOs
                    rules) without everyone noticing because everything is
                    public.
